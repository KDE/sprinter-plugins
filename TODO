== Porting Runners ==
* kde-workspace
    * bookmarks
        * BIIIIG runner, needs a good going over
        * not a good candidate for "first runner I'll port"
        * shouldn't need to copy the firefox db file, e.g.
    * locations
        * split out file location matcher (already have a URI plugin)
    * services
    * sessions
        * requires sorting out libkworkspace in kde-workspace/lib/kworkspace
          as that has most of the functionality
    * shell
        * has options on matches, including:
            * run as other user (with username/password fields)
            * run in terminal
          need some way to preserve this functionality
    * solid
        * 4.x version uses hotplug and solid Plasma::DataEngines
          should be re-written/ported to just use libsolid directly
    * webshortcuts
    * windowedwidgets
    * windows
        * done, but needs KWindowInfo to get a default constructor
        * once that is done, can be enabled and then tested
* kdeplasma-addons
    * audioplayercontrol
    * browserhistory
    * characters
    * converter
    * datetime
    * dictionary
    * events
    * katesessions
    * konquerorsessions
    * konsolesessions
    * kopete
    * mediawiki
    * spellchecker
    * translator
    * youtube

== Ideas for existing runners

=== Windows

WindowsSessionData should update the window/desktop info in realtime

make the window matches (without actions) a search term match, which when selected returns all the actions available for that window?

=== URI

Crashes somewhere in KIO. Needs investigating.
